1. Opening the Terminal:
Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Launching Python Interpreter:
Type py and press Enter. This opens the Python interactive shell.

3. Executing Python Code:
Enter Python code directly, e.g., name = "YOUR_NAME" and print(name).

4. Exiting the Python Environment:
Type quit() to exit the Python environment.
